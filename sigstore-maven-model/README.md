# Maven Sigstore Model

This is an experiment in trying to use the [JSON schemas][1] provided by the Rekor project. Currently, only three of the schemas are being used to generate Java classes, so it might be a fruitless effort but if we want to use the provided schemas more we can. Ultimately if we do use more of the schemas and generate more classes, this should be moved to the [Sigstore Java][2] project.
