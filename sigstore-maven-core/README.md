# Sigstore Maven Core

Most, or all, of what is here will eventually make its way to the [Sigstore Java][1]. Full Rekor and Fulcio clients are being developed there, along with any other general purpose Sigstore Java utilities. The first available examples of code were present in Bob Callaway's `sigstore-maven-plugin` which is where most of the code present here was taken from initially.
